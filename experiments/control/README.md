# Control / Engineering Experiments

This folder will host TRP-constrained control experiments:

- Fusion plasma stabilization and quench forecasting
- Relativistic trajectory optimization (rockets near c)
- Neural / RL update rules under TRP constraints (KL-Leash)

Planned:

- `trp_lqr_demo.py` — quadratic regulator with E_TRP penalty.
- Fusion mode suppression and quench prediction demos.
