# Computation / Complexity Experiments

This folder will host TRP-based experiments on:

- SAT hardness and TRP penalties
- Proof length and search depth under E_TRP
- TRP-based arguments toward P ≠ NP (at least as a structured conjecture)

Planned:

- `trp_sat_toy.py` — small SAT instance with TRP penalty visualization.
- Proof search simulators with TRP cost tracking.
