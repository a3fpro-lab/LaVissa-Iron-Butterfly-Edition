# Cosmology Experiments

This folder hosts TRP-based cosmology experiments:

- Hartle–Hawking exit entropy and TRP decomposition
- Anisotropy bounds vs. Planck/BICEP
- Toy demos and full HHV-TRP-Engine integrations

Current files:

- `trp_cosmology_demo.py` — small toy sweep over anisotropy ε for a fixed
  cosmological configuration, using the core TRP formulas.
