# Biology / CellIQ Experiments

This folder will host TRP-based biology experiments:

- Protein folding and misfolding as minima of E_TRP
- Cancer attractors and metabolic collapse
- Autoimmunity and microbiome TRP landscapes
- Control u(t) as therapies (CRISPR, small molecules, neuromodulation)

Planned:

- `trp_bio_landscape_demo.py` — toy 2D TRP landscape (healthy vs diseased).
- CellIQ models and real-world data integrations.
