# Quantum / Zeta / Teleportation Experiments

This folder will host experiments at the interface of:

- Quantum information (teleportation, entanglement) as TRP channels
- Riemann zeta zeros and spectral TRP signatures
- Collapse Law applied to quantum measurement and echo dynamics

Planned:

- `trp_teleportation_demo.py` — toy teleportation channel with TRP accounting.
- Zeta zeros + Pulse Signaler + TRP energy demos.
