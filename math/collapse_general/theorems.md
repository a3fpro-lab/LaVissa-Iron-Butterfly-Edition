# Collapse Law — Theorems and Results

This document is reserved for **actual theorems** and rigorous results
about collapse structures, independent of specific famous problems.

Right now, we mostly have **framework claims** and conjectures. As any
piece of the system is proven in a standard mathematical sense, it
should be recorded here with:

- Precise statement
- Proof
- References to where it is used

## 1. Placeholder

*(No fully formal theorems documented here yet.)*

As the VIREON / LaVissa program matures, any solid results (e.g.,
rigorous bounds or theorems about TRP functionals, collapse spaces, or
echo-solvable problems) should be added to this file.
