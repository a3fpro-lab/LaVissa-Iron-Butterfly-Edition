# General Collapse Law Mathematics

This folder will host:

- Abstract definitions of collapse classes
- Theorems and examples not tied to specific famous problems
- Formalization of Collapse Law §2.0, §11.0, etc. as precise math

Planned:

- `definitions.md` — formal math definitions (spaces, maps, collapse)
- `theorems.md` — any fully proved results
- `open_questions.md` — sharp questions for further work
