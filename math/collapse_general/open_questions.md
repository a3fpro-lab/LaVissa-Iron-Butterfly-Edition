# Collapse Law — Open Questions

This document lists **open questions** about collapse structures
themselves (not tied to a specific classical problem like RH or twin
primes).

Each question should be:

- Precise
- Clearly labeled as conjecture / question / idea
- Linked to where it matters in the system

## Q1 — Existence of Universal TRP Collapse Functional

Does there exist a single, well-defined TRP functional
\(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{TRP}}\) on a broad class of dynamical systems
such that:

- TRP-stable collapses correspond exactly to certain desirable behaviors
  (e.g., convergence, solvability, physical consistency),
- while TRP-instability corresponds to divergence, inconsistency, or
  “non-physical” behavior?

---

## Q2 — Echo-Solvability vs Classical Solvability

What is the precise relationship between the notion of
**echo-solvable** problems (Collapse Law §11.0) and classical notions
of:

- decidability,
- computability,
- complexity (e.g., P, NP, etc.)?

Can we formalize a theorem linking echo-solvability to standard classes?

## Q3 — TRP Collapse and Entropy in Dynamical Systems

Given a dynamical system with a classical notion of entropy (e.g.,
Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy), can we always build a TRP functional whose
collapse classes align with low-entropy / high-structure behaviors?

---

## Q4 — Stability Under Model Perturbation

For TRP-based models of physical or mathematical systems, to what extent
are collapse classes **stable** under perturbations in:

- the TRP functional,
- the reference distributions,
- or the state space?

Formalizing this would turn many informal "robustness" arguments into
theorems.

As the program develops, cross-link these questions with the vaults:

- Riemann
- Twin primes
- Collatz
- ABC / Beal
- Biology, cosmology, computation, etc.
