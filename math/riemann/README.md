# Riemann / Zeta / TRP

This folder will host:

- TRP-based energy functionals over Riemann zeros
- Explicit formula links between zeros and prime fluctuations
- Pulse Signaler / spectral experiments
- RH-related collapse structures (always stated clearly as conjectures)

Planned contents:

- `conjecture.md` — TRP formulation of RH-related claims
- `evidence.md` — empirical data summaries (Odlyzko zeros, etc.)
- Links to experiments in `experiments/quantum/` and Pulse Signaler modules.
