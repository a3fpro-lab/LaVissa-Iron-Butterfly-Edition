# TRP Control Evidence Log (Fusion / Relativity / Neuroscience)

This file tracks **experiments and simulations** related to TRP-based
control principles in `principles.md`.

Each entry should record:

- System type (fusion surrogate, rocket toy model, neural/RL system)
- TRP functional used
- Observed behavior (stability, performance, failures)
