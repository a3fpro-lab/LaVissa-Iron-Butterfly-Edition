# Collatz / Recursive Collapse

This folder will host:

- Collatz map as a TRP-driven dynamical system
- Collapse patterns, p-adic views, entropy trajectories
- Empirical scans and structural conjectures

Planned:

- `conjecture.md` — clear statement of any proposed laws
- `evidence.md` — simulations, bounds, and patterns
