# VIREON Math Vault

This directory is the **math vault** of LaVissa — the place where
domain-specific structures, conjectures, proofs, and experiments live.

It is organized by problem / theme:

- `riemann/` — Riemann zeta, RH, GUE, explicit formulas, TRP energies
- `twin_prime/` — twin prime entropy, gap structures, Collapse Law views
- `collatz/` — Collatz dynamical systems, p-adic views, TRP collapse
- `abc_beal/` — ABC, Beal, Fermat–Catalan, exponential collapse classes
- `collapse_general/` — general Collapse Law theorems and examples

Each subfolder should contain:

- `README.md` — high-level overview
- `conjecture.md` or `theorem.md` — formal statements
- `evidence.md` — empirical data summaries
- Links to experiments under `experiments/` and to papers in `papers/`.
