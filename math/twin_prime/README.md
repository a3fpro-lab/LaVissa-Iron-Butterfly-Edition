# Twin Prime / Prime Gaps

This folder will host:

- Entropy-based formulations of twin prime behavior
- Collapse Law views on prime gaps
- TRP energy interpretations of prime sequences

Planned contents:

- `conjecture.md` — specific TRP-style statements about twin primes
- `evidence.md` — numerical scans and experiments
- Pointers to explicit computations (external repos or `experiments/`).
