==============

Entropy-based plumbing / water infrastructure:

- FlowKey, ValveIQ, DropGate-X, CoreClamp
- Turbine-based power + entropy signatures
- Entropy Water Score (0–100)
- Leak / burst / contamination detection and shutoff

This module will connect the core TRP / Collapse Law logic to
sensor data streams and control actions in water systems.
